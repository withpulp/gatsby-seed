# Gatsby Seed

A gatsby starter with an opinionated architecture and components for the purpose of quickly creating SEO friendly static websites.

## Setup

Setup instruction coming soon.

## Development

### Methodology

Clean, clear, self-documenting code means you should be able to start right in the code, without having to read documentation - less reading and more doing.

To achieve this, components are structured and prop types are defined clearly. Components should also have proper testing and stories for further clarity (this is a work in progress).

### Roadmap

- Setup [hygen](https://github.com/jondot/hygen) templates for command line scaffolding of components, containers, pages, templates, and other modules.
- Setup [storybook](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook) for visual documentation of components and component compositions.
- Publish `theme` into an npm package that can be used with components.
- Publish `components` into an npm package that can be used with theme.
